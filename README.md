# odin-recipes
This is a recipe website made with only HTML, with the guidance of the Odin Project and personal adjustments.
I have solidified my understandings of the basic HTML structure. I learned how to set up a html file, how to use the various headings, paragraphs, boldings, unordered and ordered lists, links, and pictures. 
Recipes are all from allrecipes.com
