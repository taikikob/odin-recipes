            <strong>Miso soup</strong> is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. 
            Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. 
            Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice.
